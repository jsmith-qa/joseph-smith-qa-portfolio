🧪 Joseph Smith — QA Engineer Portfolio

Welcome to my QA Engineering portfolio!
This space highlights my hands-on experience with API testing, structured test design, and real-world QA projects built during my learning journey.

I focus on manual & API testing, test planning, debugging, and building clear test artifacts that improve quality and communication across teams.

🔍 About Me

I’m a QA Engineer with strengths in:

API Testing (Postman + DevTools)

Boundary & Equivalence Testing

Defect Investigation & Reporting

XML/JSON validation

SQL (learning)

Python (learning)

Browser Automation (learning)

I enjoy breaking systems down, uncovering edge-case defects, and making unclear requirements testable and clear.
